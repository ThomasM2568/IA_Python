Pandas Resampling and Frequency Conversion

Code Explanation
<a name="code-explanation"></a>

Resampling Time Series Data (Daily Average)
<a name="resampling-daily-average"></a>

daily_ts = ts.resample('D').mean()
Resamples the time series data to daily frequency and computes the daily mean.

Upsampling Time Series Data (Hourly Frequency)
<a name="upsampling-hourly"></a>

df_upsampled = df.resample('H').asfreq()
Upsamples the time series data from daily frequency to hourly frequency, inserting NaNs for missing values.

Resampling with Aggregation (Sum, Mean, Max, Min)
<a name="resampling-aggregation"></a>

resampled_mean = df.resample('2D').mean()
resampled_sum = df.resample('2D').sum()
resampled_max = df.resample('2D').max()
resampled_min = df.resample('2D').min()
Resamples the time series data to 2-day intervals and computes the sum, mean, maximum, and minimum for each period.

Downsampling Time Series Data (Minute to Hourly)
<a name="downsampling-minute-to-hourly"></a>

ts_hourly = ts.resample('H').mean()
Downsamples a minute-frequency time series to hourly frequency and computes the hourly mean.

Print Data Before and After Resampling
<a name="print-before-after-resampling"></a>

print("Original Time Series:")
print(df)

print("\nResampled Data (Mean):")
print(resampled_mean)
Displays the original time series data and the resampled data for comparison.

Conclusion
<a name="conclusion"></a>

Resampling allows for changing the frequency of time series data.
Upsampling increases the frequency of data (e.g., daily to hourly).
Downsampling reduces the frequency of data (e.g., minute to hourly).
Aggregation methods like mean, sum, max, and min help to summarize data over resampled periods.
