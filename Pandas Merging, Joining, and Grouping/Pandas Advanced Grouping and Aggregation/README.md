# Pandas Advanced Grouping and Aggregation

## Code Explanation
<a name="code-explanation"></a>

### Grouping and Summing Values
<a name="grouping-and-summing-values"></a>
```python
grouped = df.groupby(['Category', 'Type']).sum()
```
Groups the data by both 'Category' and 'Type', then sums the 'Value' column for each group.

### Grouping and Aggregating with Multiple Functions
<a name="grouping-and-aggregating"></a>
```python
grouped = df.groupby('Category').agg(['sum', 'mean', 'max'])
```
Groups the data by 'Category' and computes multiple aggregation functions (sum, mean, and max) on the 'Value' column.

### Custom Aggregation Function
<a name="custom-aggregation"></a>
```python
def custom_agg(x):
    return x.max() - x.min()

grouped = df.groupby('Category').agg(custom_agg)
```
Defines and applies a custom aggregation function that calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values within each group.

### Filtering Groups Based on Aggregated Values
<a name="filtering-groups"></a>
```python
filtered = grouped.filter(lambda x: x['Value'].sum() > 50)
```
Filters groups based on the sum of the 'Value' column, selecting only those groups where the sum exceeds 50.

## Conclusion
<a name="conclusion"></a>
- **GroupBy operations** allow for efficient aggregation of data based on categorical columns.
- **Multiple aggregations** can be computed simultaneously using `.agg()`.
- **Custom aggregation functions** provide flexibility in defining complex group-wise computations.
- **Filtering** helps narrow down groups based on aggregate criteria, offering refined data selection.
